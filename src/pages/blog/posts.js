Is it fun? Not really. Would I recommend it to a friend? Definitely not. Am I asking a bunch of rhetorical questions to increase the length of this test post? Darn tootin'. If you ever find yourself without anything to write about, I recommend throwing on some Michael McDonald, mask your inner voice with his and just see what comes to you. You might find that minute by minute, you are gaining some creative insight from a perspective you keep forgettin'.</p>"
